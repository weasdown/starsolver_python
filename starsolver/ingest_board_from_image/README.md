# Ingest a Board from an image

This directory contains a Python package for building a `Board` instance from an image of a `Board` (either complete or incomplete).

The package uses [openCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) to extract the Board from an image.
 A sample images are provided for blank and complete boards in `samples`.
